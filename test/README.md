# Tests

To test out the server, you must first install the dymouse library.

You can do that by running 

```bash
python setup.py build
python setup.py install 
```

from the parent directory (where setup.py is).

Once you've done that, you can come back here, 
and run the dymouse web server with the command:

```bash
$ python runserver.py
```

This will import all the files it needs from the 
dymouse installation directory. This is the command
you will run from the Raspberry Pi to make this
whole business work.
